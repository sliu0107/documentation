## Component Purpose

This code implements an Angular module called doubfire.projects.states.all.directives, which relies on another submodule called doubfire.projects.states.all.directives.all-projects-list, which is an all-projects-list component in its peer directory.

## Component outcomes and interactions

The main module doubles. projects.states.all.directives can be considered as a simple container, which uses dependency injection mechanism to import and integrate the sub module doubles. projects.states.all.directives.all-projects-list into the application. During this process, AngularJS will automatically load and register all services, instructions, controllers, filters, and other components related to the module.

## Component migration plan

Use the NgModule decorator and related TypeScript classes to migrate this module. Create a new Angular module all-projects-list.modules.ts and define the name and dependencies of the instruction module in it. Declare the list component, namely AllProjectsListComponent.

```AngularJS
@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AllProjectsListComponent
  ],
```

## Component review checklist

1. Check if the code is compiled without any errors or warnings.

2. Import this module into other modules of the project and use the AllProjectsListComponent component to see if it can be used normally.
