## Component Name

all.coffee

## Component Purpose

This code implements an Angular module called doubtfire.projects.states.all.directives and this module relies on another submodule called doubtfire.projects.states all.directives.all-projects-list, which is an component of all-projects-list in its peer directory.

## Component outcomes and interactions

The main module doubtfire.projects.states.all.directives can be considered as a simple container, which uses dependency injection mechanism to import and integrate the sub module doubtfire.projects.states.all.directives.all-projects-list into the application. By using this hierarchical module injection method, services, instructions, and components can continue to be injected into the module in subsequent code development. By importing the pending module, AngularJS will automatically load and register all services, instructions, controllers, filters, and other components related to the module.

## Component migration plan

1. Create an Angular module called doubtfire-projects-states-all, and use the command NG generate module doubtfire-projects-states-all.

2. Add all existing dependencies to the imports attribute of Doubtfire-Projects-States-All Module. At present, it is possible to add references to the all projects list module as follows:

```AngualrJS
@NgModule({
  declarations: [
  ],
  imports: [
    AllProjectsListModule
  ]
})
```

In the component that needs to use the double fire projects states all module, import and add it to the imports attribute of the NgModule of that module

## Component review checklist

1. Check if the code is compiled without any errors or warnings.

2. Import the module into other modules of the project and use the components and instructions in the module to see if it can be used normally.

The website interface is actually the same as the previous one because there is no code about defining interface components. As a result, the website will be completely blank.

## *Component review checklist*

This component’s code is too simple, I reckon that it does not need a lot of checklists as long as the syntax is correct.

Successfully define a module called 'doubtfire.projects.states.all'

Its dependency module is 'doubtfire.projects.states.all.directives’
